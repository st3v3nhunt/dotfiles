# To do:

- [ ] Split [.vimrc](./dotfiles/.vimrc) into multiple files
- [ ] Is it possible to have a base `.tmux.conf` to contain the majority of the
  settings and then have the OS specific file added to it?
- [ ] Upgrade Vim on WSL to get rid of ale error disappearing cursor bug
- [ ] Review `.tmux.conf` and remove any unnecessary config
