# 3. Switch to use zsh in place of bash

Date: 2019-10-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

[Starting with macOS Catalina, zsh will be the default shell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050).

## Decision

zsh should be used in place of bash.

## Consequences

There are some differences between the shells which will require changes to the
way they are configured. There may be a small learning curve whilst getting
used to any differences between the shells.
zsh is widely thought of to be a better shell than bash and there should be
some productivity gains to be had.
