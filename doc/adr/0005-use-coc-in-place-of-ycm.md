# 5. Use CoC in place of YCM

Date: 2021-01-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

YCM has been a mostly positive experience over the years of using it, however,
there have been many occasions where time has been spent fixing issues. The
time has come to look at using an alternative.

## Decision

The decision is to use [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

## Consequences

Using any new tool takes a bit of time to get up to speed, however, the
functionality available appears to largely match that available within YCM.
Therefore, the learning is largely going to the nuances of how the
functionality is implemented rather than learning a set of new functionality.
There might be issues with CoC that I haven't been made aware of during testing
in which the use of CoC would need to be considered against the effort involved
in resolving them against the known experience of YCM.
