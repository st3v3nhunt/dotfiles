# Dot files

Clone the repo somewhere on the local disk and run `./install.sh`. This will:

* Symlink all dotfiles into the user's home directory
* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and some packages
* Install [Caskroom](https://caskroom.github.io/) and some applications

During the install of Homebrew you will be prompted for your password.
